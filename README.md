see hypercube.py for the .tsv file structure

to make .tex file to include in another file: `make example.tex` will convert `example.tsv`

to make standalone .tex files: `v=s make example.tex`, and `v=s make example.pdf` will also compile it for you (requires tectonic)

to put headers on the headers: `v=h`

`d=example make` to convert all .tsv files in a subdirectory
